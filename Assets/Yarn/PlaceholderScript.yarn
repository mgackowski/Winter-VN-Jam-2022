Troll: Ah, I see. The right to protect oneself, Traveller?
Traveller: Y-yeah. It's a wolf eat wolf world out there.
Troll: Bah! Hah! You see yourself a wolf, Traveller? Now that, I find amusing.
Troll: It is true that, faced with harsh circumstances, the noble wolf may turn against others of its own kind.
Troll: Then tell me this Traveller - are your present circumstances so dire, so threatening, that you would eat your own pup to survive?
Troll: Because what I see is a rather well fed tabby resting by a fireplace!
Traveller: Look, it's a human expression- hey!
